## What is it?

PyAwaitable is the *only* library to support writing and calling asynchronous Python functions from pure C code (with the exception of manually implementing an awaitable class from scratch, which is essentially what PyAwaitable does).

It was originally designed to be directly part of CPython--you can read the [scrapped PEP](https://gist.github.com/ZeroIntensity/8d32e94b243529c7e1c27349e972d926) about it. Since this library only uses the public ABI, it's better fit outside of CPython, as a library.

## Installation

Add it to your project's build process:

```toml
# pyproject.toml example with setuptools
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools", "pyawaitable"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
```

Include it in your extension:

```py
from setuptools import setup, Extension
import pyawaitable

if __name__ == "__main__":
    setup(
        ...,
        ext_modules=[Extension(..., include_dirs=[pyawaitable.include()])]
    )
```

## Example

```c
#include <pyawaitable.h>

/* Usage from Python: await my_async_function(coro()) */
static PyObject *
my_async_function(PyObject *self, PyObject *coro) {
    /* Make our awaitable object */
    PyObject *awaitable = PyAwaitable_New();

    /* Mark the coroutine for being awaited */
    PyAwaitable_AddAwait(awaitable, coro, NULL, NULL);

    /* Return the awaitable object to yield to the event loop */
    return awaitable;
}
```
